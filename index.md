## Experiments

Participants needed! I am runing all the experiments *online* at the moment, so you only need a laptop/desktop/tablet/mobile phone and preferably a quiet room to complete some speech-related tasks. If you are interested participating in the following experiments, feel free to email me (*lz1136@york.ac.uk*). Your participation will be highly appreciated!

### Mandarin dialect production

I am currently recruiting native speakers of six Mandarin dialects (**Beijing, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Chengud, Wuhan dialect**) to remotely record production of dialectal speech using smartphone recording apps. 


### Mandarin dialect perception

A pilot study on perception of unfamiliar tone systems is about to launch. If you are a native speaker of Standard Mandarin, you are eligible!
