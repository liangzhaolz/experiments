## Experiments

Participants needed! I am running all the experiments *online* at the moment. You only need a laptop/desktop/tablet/mobile phone and preferably a quiet room to complete some speech-related tasks. If you are interested participating in the following experiments, feel free to email me. Your participation will be highly appreciated!

### Mandarin dialect production

I am currently recruiting native speakers of six Mandarin dialects (**Beijing, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Chengdu, Wuhan dialect**) to remotely record production of dialectal speech using smartphone recording apps. 


### Mandarin dialect perception

A pilot study on perception of unfamiliar tone systems is about to launch. If you are a native speaker of **Standard Mandarin**, you are eligible!
